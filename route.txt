to handle /recipe/2 this type of urls
we have to make url of app.route("/recipe/<int:recipe_id>")
in this case router understand that 2 of /recipe/2 url 
is recipe_id and send to function recipe_id

def view_recipes(recipe_id) where recipe_id = 2

data ={
    key: value,
    'id': 1,
}

variable = value
('username',) set of values
